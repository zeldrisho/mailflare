## What you can do

- **Domains**: Connect your Cloudflare domains and choose Cloudflare, Resend, or Amazon SES for each.
- **Mailboxes**: Create personal or shared mailboxes and give other people access to them.
- **Email**: Send and receive mail with attachments, rich text, signatures, and automatic replies.
- **Calendar**: Schedule repeating events with time zones and attendees, who receive email invitations.
- **Booking pages**: Share a public link so anyone can book a free time on your calendar.
- **Organization**: Keep your inbox tidy with search, folders, stars, snooze, archive, spam, and trash.
- **Routing rules**: Store, forward, reject, or sort incoming mail automatically.
- **Notifications**: Get live inbox updates and alerts when new mail arrives.
- **Import, export, contacts**: Move mail in and out, manage contacts, and block unwanted senders.
- **Admin**: Manage users, permissions, API keys, webhooks, audit logs, and backups.
- **AI assistant**: Search your mail, draft replies, and manage calendar events with AI.
- **MCP access**: Connect AI clients over MCP, with separate permissions for each key.
- **Languages**: Use the interface in 33 languages: English, Português (Brasil), Português (Portugal), Español, Français, Deutsch, Italiano, Nederlands, Polski, Українська, Русский, Türkçe, 中文（简体）, 日本語, 한국어, Bahasa Indonesia, Bahasa Melayu, Tiếng Việt, ไทย, हिन्दी, বাংলা, मराठी, తెలుగు, தமிழ், ગુજરાતી, ಕನ್ನಡ, മലയാളം, ਪੰਜਾਬੀ, Kiswahili, Hausa, plus العربية, اردو and فارسی (right-to-left).

## How it works

Mailflare runs in your Cloudflare account. By default, Cloudflare Email Routing delivers incoming mail to the app, and Cloudflare's email service sends outgoing mail. Each domain can also receive or send through Resend or Amazon SES. Cloudflare still manages the DNS.

Your mail stays in your own D1 database, and attachments stay in your own R2, Backblaze B2 or AWS S3 bucket, whichever provider you use. See [Sending and receiving providers](docs/providers.md).

## Cost

**You can set up Mailflare, receive mail, and send mail for free.** Receiving with Cloudflare Email Routing is free. For sending, use the free tier of Resend or Amazon SES. Cloudflare's own email sending needs a paid Worker plan.

| Send with                    | Free tier                                                                                                            | After that                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Resend**                   | 3,000 emails a month (100 a day), 3 domains                                                                          | From $20/month for 50,000 emails                                                                   |
| **Amazon SES**               | $200 AWS credit for new accounts (about 2 million emails). The free plan lasts 6 months and credits expire after 12. | $0.10 per 1,000 emails                                                                             |
| **Cloudflare Email Sending** | None                                                                                                                 | Needs a [Paid Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/) plan ($5/month) |

Receiving costs:

- Cloudflare Email Routing: free.
- Resend: included in every plan.
- Amazon SES: $0.10 per 1,000 messages, plus small S3 and SNS charges.

New SES accounts start in a sandbox that only delivers to verified addresses. Request production access in the AWS console to lift this.

You choose the provider per domain and can switch anytime (see [Sending and receiving providers](docs/providers.md)). Prices change, so check [Resend](https://resend.com/pricing), [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/), and [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/) first.

## Deploy

1. **Deploy the app.** Click **Deploy to Cloudflare**. Keep the app name `mailflare`. Other Worker names will break the app.
2. **Finish setup.** Open the deployed app and follow `/setup` to check the install and create your admin account.
3. **Connect a domain.** Add a domain from the same Cloudflare account and choose which service receives its mail. Mailflare sets up Email Routing, or guides you through Resend or Amazon SES. Then create your first mailbox. Add Resend or AWS credentials on the domain page when you need them.

⚠️ **`CF_TOKEN` is required during deployment.** Create a scoped [Cloudflare API token with these permissions](https://github.com/hieunc229/mailflare/issues/24#issuecomment-5523686105) for the domains you want to connect:

- All accounts: Email Sending:Edit, DNS Settings:Edit, Email Routing Addresses:Edit
- All zones: DNS Settings:Edit, Email Routing Rules:Edit, Zone Settings:Edit, DNS:Edit

### Deploy with an AI coding agent

Paste the prompt below into an agent with terminal access. Give it your Cloudflare account ID and **two separate scoped API tokens** through the agent's secret input. Never put them in a public chat, repository, or committed file.

- **Deployment token** (the `cf` CLI uses it as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`): scope it to the target account with **Workers Scripts Edit** (or **Workers Admin** if you see Cloudflare's newer roles), **D1 Edit**, **Workers R2 Storage Edit**, **Queues Edit**, and **Account Settings Read**. Add **Workers Routes Edit** for the target zone only if the agent should attach a custom domain or route. See Cloudflare's [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) and [Workers roles](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/authorization/workers/).
- **Runtime token** (stored as the Worker secret `CF_TOKEN`): use the domain permissions above. Add **Email Sending Edit** to send mail. It must cover the zones you will connect in Mailflare.

```text
Install Mailflare from https://github.com/hieunc229/mailflare in my Cloudflare account.
Ask me for my Cloudflare account ID, a scoped deployment API token, and a separate
runtime CF_TOKEN through a secret input. Never print, commit, or place either token
in a command argument or a tracked file. Use the deployment token only for `cf`
authentication (`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`).

Read README.md, docs/deployment.md, and cloudflare.config.ts first. Keep the Worker name
exactly mailflare. In the selected account, create or reuse the D1 database
mailflare, R2 bucket mailflare-raw, and Queues mailflare-inbound,
mailflare-outbound, and mailflare-agent. Install dependencies with vp install,
run vp run deploy, and set the runtime CF_TOKEN as a Worker secret. Do not run
remote D1 migrations manually; the /setup flow initializes the database.

Give me the deployed URL and any remaining Cloudflare account actions. I will
open /setup, create the first admin account, and connect my domain there.
```

See the [deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) for permissions, manual deployment, backups, and updates.

### Self-host on Node.js

Mailflare can also run on a Node.js server using SQLite and local files instead of D1 and R2. See [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md) for setup, mail providers, and operations.

## Local development

```bash
vp exec cf auth login
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
vp install
vp run db:migrate:local
vp run dev
```

Add your Cloudflare credentials to `.dev.vars`, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). To load sample data, run `vp run db:seed` while the dev server is running.

The Cloudflare app uses vinext and the Cloudflare Vite plugin, with local D1, R2, Queues, and Durable Objects. Remote bindings are off by default. To use Workers AI locally, authenticate with `vp exec cf auth login`, set `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, and run `CLOUDFLARE_REMOTE_BINDINGS=true vp run dev`.

- `vp run build`: build the full Worker.
- `vp run start`: preview that build locally.
- `vp run deploy`: build and deploy.

The Node.js runtime uses Next.js with `build:node`, `start:node`, and `dev:node`.

## Languages

Everyone can switch language from the homepage or sign-in page, and signed-in users can set it under **Settings → Account → General**, next to their time zone. The choice is kept in a cookie, so server-rendered pages use it too.

To add a language, create `public/locales/<code>.json` with the same keys as `src/lib/i18n/en.json`, then register it in `src/lib/i18n/locales.ts` with its native name (add `dir: "rtl"` for right-to-left scripts). The selector, validation, and cookie handling pick it up from that registry. Missing keys fall back to English. English ships in the main bundle; other catalogs are static assets loaded on demand, outside the Worker size limit.
