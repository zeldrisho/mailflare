# Repository agent instructions

## Database backup and restore

- Whenever a migration creates, renames, or removes a persisted table, update the backup and restore table lists in the same change, even if the feature is unrelated to backups. Review `BACKUP_TABLES` and `INTERNAL_TABLES` in `src/lib/backups/export.ts`, `BACKUP_TABLE_GROUPS` in `src/lib/backups/table-groups.ts`, and `DatabaseBackupTable` in `src/lib/backups/types.d.ts`.
- Put every backed-up table in exactly one group. Keep `BACKUP_TABLES` in foreign-key dependency order so restore inserts parents before children and deletes them in reverse order. Exclude a table only when its contents are derived or internally managed, and document why.
- When adding a table, check backup and restore behavior both before and after its migration is applied. Keep older full backup documents restorable.

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a `vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the project defines a script or task with that name.

## Tool Versions

Run `vp toolchain` to show versions and relationships in the active Vite+ release. Add a tool name to select part of the graph. For example, run `vp toolchain vite`. Use `--global` to ignore the local `vite-plus` package. Use `vp why <package>` to show the package-manager dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.
